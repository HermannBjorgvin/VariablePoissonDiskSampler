# VariablePoissonDiskSampler
An algorithm that takes an image and generates a Poisson disk based on the pixel values of the image, ridiculously fast (if I do say so myself). See demo at http://hermann.is/poisson

Todo: Write functions to replace underscore as a dependency, package as module for AMD, CommonJS, Jquery, or standalone
